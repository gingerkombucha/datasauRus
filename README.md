# datasauRus
Shows how datasets with similar descriptions can produce entirely different graphical outputs.

This project was meant to demonstrate how graphical representation is important to understand data.

The code is based on the following source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datasauRus/vignettes/Datasaurus.html

The project helps to illustrate, in a different way, the original Anscombe's quartet:

"Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet appear very different 
when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe
to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. 
He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact,
but graphs are rough." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet
